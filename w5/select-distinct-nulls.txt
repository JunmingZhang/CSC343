-- Does SELECT DISTINCT treat two NULLs as the same?

-- Setup:

csc343h-dianeh=> create table X(a int, b int);
CREATE TABLE
csc343h-dianeh=> insert into X values (1, 2), (null, 3), (null, 4);
INSERT 0 3
csc343h-dianeh=> select * from X
csc343h-dianeh-> ;
 a | b 
---+---
 1 | 2
   | 3
   | 4
(3 rows)

-- If we ask for just column a, of course we will see the two NULL values.

csc343h-dianeh=> select a from X;
 a 
---
 1
  
  
(3 rows)

-- If we ask for distinct values, the two NULLs are collapsed to one.
-- SELECT DISTINCT has considered the two NULL values to be the same.

csc343h-dianeh=> select distinct a from x;
 a 
---
 1
  
(2 rows)

-- But notice that it didn't consider NULL to be the same as 1, or it
-- would have had to remove either the 1 or the NULL in order to give us 
-- distinct values.
